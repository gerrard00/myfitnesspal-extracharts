# myfitnesspal-extracharts

Adds some extra charts to MyFitnessPal.

MyFitnessPal has changed my life and the lives of many others by making calorie counting simple and enjoyable. I love everything about MyFitnessPal, except for their charts. They leave much to be desired, especially if you want to weigh yourself daily.

This extension adds an extra chart to the MyFitnessPal reports page that shows an exponentially smoothed moving average. This functionality was inspired by "The Hacker's Diet".

The extension does not store or otherwise analyze any of your information. We just enhance the existing browser experience when visiting the MyFitnessPal reports page.

Please note that this is a super early beta. I will be enhancing it regularly.
